# Heads-Up!
Heads Up! is a multiplayer word-guessing game where one player holds the phone to their forehead without knowing the word shown in screen, and the other players try to give them clues to that word without mentioning the taboos (forbidden phrases). Each word round has 60 seconds.
The game is currently limited to celebs but it could be expanded to contain any category of words.
